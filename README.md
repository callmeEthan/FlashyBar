# FlashyBar
A simple bar with a flash effect moving across the bar to indicate activity.  
Rewrite from my setup for easier general use.

## Usage
Each bar have their own Settings.inc and layout.inc file, user should edit them if necessary.  
CPU stats are from [core temp](https://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/), you can edit skin .ini and change measure appropriately if you have different program.  
GPU stats are from [MSI Afterburner](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/msi-afterburner-beta-download.html)
